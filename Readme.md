# ☁️ AWS Cloud Engineer – Hands-on Learning Journey

Welcome to my **AWS Cloud Engineering Hands-on Portfolio**.

This repository documents my complete **practical journey of learning AWS from zero to production-level architecture**, focusing on real-world scenarios used by cloud and DevOps engineers.

Every day includes hands-on labs, architecture understanding, and production-style implementations.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

**Name:** Prarabdh Soni  
**Role:** Full Stack Developer → Cloud Engineer (in progress)  
**Goal:** Become a production-ready Cloud / DevOps Engineer  

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

- Learn by building
- Understand *why*, not just *how*
- Think like a cloud engineer
- Follow industry best practices
- Focus on scalability, security, and cost optimization


All experiments are **production-oriented**, simulating enterprise-level workflows.
