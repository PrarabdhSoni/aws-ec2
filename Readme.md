# ☁️ AWS EC2 Masterclass Portfolio

## Hi, I'm Prarabdh Soni 👋
Cloud Engineer in training | DevOps Enthusiast | AWS EC2 Hands-on

This repository showcases **my practical hands-on journey with AWS EC2**, covering:

- Instance setup & management  
- Storage with EBS volumes  
- Networking with Elastic IPs  
- AMI creation & Golden AMI strategy  
- IAM security hardening

All experiments are **production-oriented**, simulating enterprise-level workflows.
